                        <p class="description">Stefan Sagmeister was born in the small Austrian town of Bregenz in 1962. He states that after failing as a musician and a writer, he became a designer. He moved on to study graphic design at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna after realising he was more interested in the layouts of newspapers and CDs. He received a Fulbright grant to attend the Pratt Institute in New York in 1987, following which he worked for the Leo Burnett Design Group in Hong Kong until 1993, when he returned to New York to work with the Hungarian graphic designer Tibor Kalman. </p>
                        <p class="description">Stefan Sagmeister is a designer who combines text and graphics in unexpected, daring, and disturbing ways. He is likely most recognised for his album covers for Talking Heads, Lou Reed, OK Go, and The Rolling Stones, to mention a few, as well as inventive campaigns for corporations like Levis that have reached the public awareness over the last decade. </p>
